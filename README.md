##  customer-segmentation
In this project to divide the dataset into segments based on their similarities I used K-Means algorithm.

Python need to be installed.
To install Python click [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)
To open jupyter notebooks 
use the following command:
```
  python3 -m notebook 
```
Import the necessary libraries :
```
import pandas as pd 
import sqlite3
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
import numpy as np
```
In the Notebooks Folder you can find 4 Notebooks:

1.Data Cleaning: In this Notebook I focused more on removing duplicates, handling missing_values.

2.Exploring Data with SQL: In this Notebook I focused on connecting data to SQL, running SQL queries qith python 

3.Data visualisation: In this notebook I focused more on Data Visualisation techniques with python and matplotlib.I answered the questions like 'Top Countries' and I used group by function to segment the customers into 3 groups based on the frequency on the customers 

4.customer_segmentation_kmeans: In this Notebook I focused on segmenting dataset into 4 clusters using RFM and K-Means
